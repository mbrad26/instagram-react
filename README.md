Instagram clone build with styled-components

## Why using CSS-in-JS?

* **Reduce the number of HTTP requests** - don't have to make a HTTP request to load assets and resources
* **Styling Fragmentation** - you can write styles freely without worrying about compatibility issues

## Why styled components?

* **No class name bugs** - generates unique class names
* **Easier deletion of CSS** - every bit of styling is tied to a specific component
* **Painless maintenance**

## Install styled components

```
npm install styled-components
```
